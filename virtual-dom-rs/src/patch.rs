/// A `Patch` encodes an operation that modifies a real DOM element.
///
/// To update the real DOM that a user sees you'll want to first diff your
/// old virtual dom and new virtual dom.
///
/// This diff operation will generate `Vec<Patch>` with zero or more patches that, when
/// applied to your real DOM, will make your real DOM look like your new virtual dom.
///
/// Each `Patch` has a u32 node index that helps us identify the real DOM node that it applies to.
///
/// Our old virtual dom's nodes are indexed depth first, as shown in this illustration
/// (0 being the root node, 1 being it's first child, 4 being it's second child).
