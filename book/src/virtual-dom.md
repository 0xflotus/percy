# Virtual DOM

At the heart of the `Percy` toolkit is `virtual-dom-rs`, a crate that includes a virtual dom
implementation that allows you to write functional front-end applications.

This same `virtual-dom-rs` also works on the backend by rendering to a String instead of a DOM element.
This ability to render on the backend is commonly referred to as server side rendering.

```
#[macro_use]
extern crate virtual_dom_rs;

// The most basic example of rendering to a String
fn main () {
  let component = html! { <div> {"Hello world"} </div> };
  println!("{}", component);
  // <div>Hello world</div>
}
```
