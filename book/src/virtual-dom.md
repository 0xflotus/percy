# Virtual DOM

At the heart of `Percy` is a virtual dom implementation that allows
you to write functional front-end applications.

This same virtual-dom works on the backend without a real DOM,
allowing you to render your application not only in your browser,
but on the server side as well. This is commonly referred to as 
server side rendering.
