# Unit Testing your Views

Percy's testing story is very much a work in progress, so please give feedback as you write tests!

Here's an example of unit testing your views. You can find it in the examples directory at [examples/unit-testing-views][unit-test-example].

```rust
{{#include ../../../examples/unit-testing-components/src/main.rs}}
```
